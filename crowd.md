Accuracy is the proximity of measurement results to the true value
Precision, the repeatability, or reproducibility of the measurement

## ToDo
- Make a Beautiful plot of the accuracy
- Connect the dataset to the shiny
- Make the notebook pretty
- Publish on shiny apps
- Make the algorithm as a package


- Maybe we want to see the pattern also changing the number of tasks to train


### Next steps
- Improving the algorithm
    - Make all the loops and iterations as a functions or whiles, to optimize the computational process
    - Make all this loops one full function
    - Put the algorithm as a package
- Second phase analysis
    - Fixed the number of tasks and workers
    - Evaluate the number of workers per task (default = 7)
