They are often contrasted with Evangelicals, though this is very much a simplification. Most members of both parties considered themselves orthodox Christians and the leaders - Principal Roberston for the Moderates and his Edinburgh University colleague, John Erskine for the Evangelicals - had a very warm and mutually respectful relationship. They were characteristically very much part of the Scottish Enlightenment contributing to and deriving intellectual nourishment from an impressive range of scholarly activities of the time - literary, philosophical, historical and scientific. They shared - far too easily, in the view of critics - widespread scepticism of Puritanical enthusiasm evident in the many revival movements of the age.
